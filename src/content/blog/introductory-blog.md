# Why I'm Starting This Website

As a developer, learning is a continuous journey, and I’m passionate about exploring new technologies and solving real-world problems. Over the years, I’ve realized that understanding a concept deeply often comes from teaching or explaining it to others. That’s why I’m starting this website — to not only document my progress but also share my experiences, thoughts, and challenges as I navigate through the ever-evolving tech landscape. 

This platform will be my space to dive into the latest tools, frameworks, and methodologies I’m working with. By breaking down complex topics into simpler ideas, I aim to help others on their learning path, while reinforcing my own understanding. Whether you’re a fellow developer or just curious about technology, I hope you’ll find something valuable here. I would also regularly post summaries of books that I am reading sometimes more detailed chapter by chapter and sometimes just a high level takeaways that I found interesting in the book. Stay tuned for regular posts on what I’m learning and building!
